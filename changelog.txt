Compatible with MyBB 1.8.

Fixed XSS vulnerability - I was sanitising the wrong variable, my bad.

Fixed a permissions problems.

Now, you can add the status veriable to the postbit if you want.
Fixed a bug that would make AJAX not to work after the first time you change your status via AJAX, if you didn't refresh the page.
Added a bar to the index page (if the setting "What am I doing? Behaviour" is set to yes).

* 1.2
Fixed one bug.
Added a link which is displayed as "(Change)" after the custom status in profiles. If you click the link, a popup box will appear and you'll have to enter the new status. It will save your new status via AJAX.
